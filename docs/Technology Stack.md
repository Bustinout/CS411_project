## Explanation for Choices:
For the front end we did not choose a framework because we did not think it was necessary for our early prototype. The only things we had to decide on for our stack were the tools. We chose Brackets for its speed and because we are just making a simple html file so far. We used Codeshare.io to work on the same piece of code together. We have not used Postman yet, but we are sure we will eventually.
